Do you want a DIY NAS?  Do you want to set up FreeNAS?  Have you considered virtualizing FreeNAS with Proxmox?   In this video we'll walk through installing and setting up FreeNAS and configure a samba share for Windows.  We'll also install it on a virtual server using ProxmoxVE that's running in my Homelab.  Both are free and open source.
