## Description

Well, here it is!  My Late 2022 Server Rack and HomeLab tour!  This is a special one because I just revamped my entire rack.  I've upgraded, replaced, added, and consolidated quite a bit since my last tour!  New servers, new networking, new UPS, new power management, and even a whole entire wall of tech gear.  I also added lots of automation and IoT devices! Join me as we walk through my server rack transfer and upgrade!
